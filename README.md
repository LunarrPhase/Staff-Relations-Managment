## Project Structure



- **.github/workflows/**: Contains YAML files that define automated workflows for GitHub Actions, specifying tasks such as testing, building, and deploying code.
- **.vscode/**: Contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code, such as settings, launch configurations, and extensions specific to the project.
- **Documentation/**: A directory dedicated to documentation related to the project. This could include user guides, API documentation, design documents, and more.
- **__tests__/**: Contains test files and test-related utilities. These are typically automated tests that ensure the application behaves as expected.
- **coverage/**: Holds code coverage reports generated by testing tools. Code coverage reports show how much of the code is covered by tests.
- **firebase_tests/**: Likely contains test files specifically for Firebase-related functionality in the application.
- **node_modules/**: A directory where npm (Node Package Manager) installs the project dependencies. This directory is usually populated automatically and should not be manually edited.
- **public/**: Contains publicly accessible files for the web application, such as the main HTML file, favicon, and static assets.
- **src/**: The source code for the application. This directory contains the main application logic and structure.
  - **assets/**: Contains static assets like images, stylesheets, and fonts.
  - **components/**: Houses reusable React components that can be used throughout the application.
  - **pages/**: Contains main pages or views of the application, each typically corresponding to different routes.
  - **services/**: Includes functions and utilities for making API calls to backend services.
  - `App.js`: The root component that sets up the application routes and layout.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the application, where the React app is rendered to the DOM.
- **.DS_Store**: A macOS system file that stores custom attributes of a folder, such as the position of icons. It is usually not needed and is often included in `.gitignore`.
- **.firebaserc**: A Firebase configuration file that defines project aliases and settings for the Firebase CLI.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This prevents certain files from being tracked in version control, such as node_modules, build output, and sensitive information.
- **README.md**: A markdown file that typically contains the documentation for the project. It often includes information on how to set up, run, and contribute to the project.
- **app.js**: Could be an additional entry point or server configuration file depending on the project setup. The specific role can vary based on the project's structure and requirements.
- **babel.config.js**: Configuration file for Babel, a JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript into a version compatible with older environments.
- **database-debug.log**: A log file capturing debug information related to database operations. Useful for troubleshooting issues with database interactions.
- **database.rules.json**: Contains security rules for the database, typically for Firebase. These rules govern how data can be read and written in the database.
- **firebase.json**: Configuration file for Firebase CLI, specifying how the project should be deployed and which Firebase services are used.
- **firebase-debug.log**: A log file capturing debug information for Firebase-related operations. Useful for diagnosing issues with Firebase services.
- **firestire.indexes.json**: Likely a typo and should be `firestore.indexes.json`, containing configuration for Firestore indexes which optimize query performance.
- **firestore.rules**: Security rules for Firestore, defining how data can be accessed and modified in the Firestore database.
- **main-page.js**: Could be a main entry point or a specific page component for the application, depending on the context.
- **mock.js**: Contains mock data or functions for testing purposes. Useful for simulating backend responses during development and testing.
- **package-lock.json**: Automatically generated file that locks the versions of dependencies installed via npm. Ensures consistent installs across different environments.
- **package.json**: Contains project metadata, such as name, version, scripts, and dependencies. This file is essential for managing the project's dependencies and scripts.
- **ui-debug.log**: A log file capturing debug information related to the UI. Useful for troubleshooting user interface issues.
