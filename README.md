## Project Structure

- **.github/workflows/**: Contains YAML files that define automated workflows for GitHub Actions, specifying tasks such as testing, building, and deploying code.
- **.vscode/**: Contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code, such as settings, launch configurations, and extensions specific to the project.
- **__tests__/**: Contains test files for the app functions. These are automated tests that ensure the application behaves as expected.
- **coverage/**: Holds code coverage reports generated by testing tools. Code coverage reports show how much of the code is covered by tests.
- **node_modules/**: A directory where npm (Node Package Manager) installs the project dependencies. This directory is populated automatically and should not be manually edited.
- **src/**: The source code for the application. This directory contains all the html, css, js, and media.
  - **firebase_functions.js** and **functions.js**: Contains functions used in various parts of the app such as carwash bookings, timesheets, and reports.
  - **firestore-import.js**: Houses firestore imports.
  - **firebaseInit.js**: Initializes firebase database so we can use its services and exports firebase functions.
  - **database-imports.js**: Houses imports for firebase realtime database
- **.DS_Store**: A macOS system file that stores custom attributes of a folder, such as the position of icons.
  
- **README.md**: A markdown file that contains the documentation for the project. It includes information on how to set up, run, and contribute to the project. It is this file.

- **app.js**: This `app.js` file creates a basic Express.js server that serves static files from three directories: "src", "test", and "src/img". It sets the server port dynamically, either taking it from the environment variable `process.env.PORT` or defaulting to port 3000. Once the server is running, it logs a message to the console indicating the port on which the server is listening.
- **babel.config.js**: configures Babel to use the @babel/preset-env preset with specific target environments. In this case, it targets the current version of Node.js (node: 'current'). This configuration ensures that Babel will transpile JavaScript code in a way that is compatible with the current Node.js environment.
- **mocks.js**: provides mock implementations of Firebase functions, Firestore operations, and other application functions for unit testing purposes. It simulates various authentication and database scenarios, input validations, error handling, and UI manipulations.
- **package-lock.json**: generated by npm that lists specific versions of packages and their dependencies, ensuring consistent installations across different environments.
- **package.json**: a metadata file for Node.js projects, containing information like project name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It's used by npm for package management and project configuration.
- **ui-debug.log**:  contains log messages related to the startup of a web/API server, indicating successful server initiation on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses at port 4000.
